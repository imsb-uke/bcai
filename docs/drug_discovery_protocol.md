# Drug discovery protocol

Here are the steps for drug discovery:

1. Obtain the 3D struture of protein (pdb file): This can be achived throgh experimemtal data at https://www.rcsb.org/ or using AI, for example using ESM3 or AlphaFold3.

2. Drug screening: we use molecular docking tools such as vina, smina, gnina, diffdock. Accordingly, we find hits.

3. Molecular dynamic simulation: for lead optimization.
