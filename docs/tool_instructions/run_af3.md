# AF3 Tool Documentation

## Overview

AlphaFild3 (AF3) is a AI-based model designed to perform molecular struture prediction, such as protein 3d struture prediction and molecular docking. An MCP tool named as ```run_af3``` is provided to run ESM3 perfroming different tasks:

1. **Single protein structure:** Predicting the protein's 3d structure.
2. **Multimer structure:** Predicting the 3d structure and binding pose of multiple proteins as a complex or multimer.
2. **Protein-ligand structure:** Predicting the 3d structure and binding pose of proteins and small molecules. This task is equivalent to molecular docking.
